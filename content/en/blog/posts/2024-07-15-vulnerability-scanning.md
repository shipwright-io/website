## Introduction

In the modern software development era, containers have become an essential tool for developers. They offer a consistent environment for applications to run, making it easier to develop, test, and deploy software across different platforms. However, like any other technology, containers are not immune to security vulnerabilities. This is where vulnerability scanning for container images becomes crucial.
In this blog, we will discuss how to run vulnerability scanning on container images with [Shipwright](https://shipwright.io/) while building those images. Before jumping into this feature, let's explain what Shipwright is and why vulnerability scanning is important.

## What is Shipwright

[Shipwright](https://shipwright.io/) is an open-source framework designed to facilitate the building of container images directly within Kubernetes environments. It aims to streamline the development and deployment process by providing a native Kubernetes solution for creating container images from source code.
Shipwright supports multiple build strategies and tools, such as Kaniko and Buildah, providing flexibility and extensibility to meet various application needs. This Kubernetes-native solution helps ensure that container images are built efficiently and securely, leveraging the strengths of the Kubernetes ecosystem

Shipwright consists of four core components:
1. BuildStrategy and ClusterBuildStrategy - defines how to build an application for an image building tool.
2. Build - defines what to build, and where the application should be delivered.
3. BuildRun - invokes the build, telling the Kubernetes cluster when to build your application.

## Why is Vulnerability Scanning Important?

Vulnerability scanning for container images involves examining the image for known security vulnerabilities. This is typically done using automated tools that compare the contents of the image against a database of known vulnerabilities. The key reasons for Vulnerability Scanning are:
Security: Containers often include third-party libraries and dependencies, which might have known vulnerabilities. If these vulnerabilities are exploited, they can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and other security incidents.
Compliance: Many industries have regulatory requirements that mandate regular security assessments, including vulnerability scanning. Ensuring your container images are free from known vulnerabilities helps in meeting these compliance standards.
Stability: Vulnerabilities can also impact the stability and performance of your applications. By identifying and fixing these issues early, you can maintain the reliability of your software.

There are many popular tools available for vulnerability scanning of container images, such as Clair, Trivy, Aqua Security, and Snyk. In Shipwright, we use Trivy under the covers for vulnerability scanning.

## Vulnerability Scanning in Shipwright

Before we dive in how it works, lets explore the options offered by shipwright for vulnerability scanning of container builds :

```yaml
spec:
  output:
    vulnerabilityScan:
      enabled: true
      failOnFinding: true  #image won't be push to registry if set to true
      ignore:
        issues:
          - CVE-2022-12345 #specify list of cve to be ignored
        severity: Low | Medium | High | Critical
        unfixed: true #ignores the unfixed vulnerabilities
```

**Configuration Options**

- vulnerabilityScan.enabled - Specify whether to run vulnerability scan for image. The supported values are true and false.
- vulnerabilityScan.failOnFinding - indicates whether to fail the build run if the vulnerability scan results in vulnerabilities. The supported values are true and false. This field is optional and false by default.
- vulnerabilityScan.ignore.issues - references the security issues to be ignored in vulnerability scan
- vulnerabilityScan.ignore.severity - denotes the severity levels of security issues to be ignored, valid values are :
    - low : it will exclude low severity vulnerabilities, displaying only medium, high and critical vulnerabilities
    - medium : it will exclude low and medium severity vulnerabilities, displaying only high and critical vulnerabilities
    - high : it will exclude low, medium and high severity vulnerabilities, displaying only the critical vulnerabilities
- vulnerabilityScan.ignore.unfixed - indicates to ignore vulnerabilities for which no fix exists. The supported types are true and false.

## Lets dive right in

Now, let's see vulnerability scanning for a container image with Shipwright in action.
If you want to try out in kind cluster, follow the steps from [this](https://github.com/shipwright-io/build?tab=readme-ov-file#try-it) section till you create the push secret.
As a next step, create a build object with vulnerability scanning enabled, replacing <REGISTRY_ORG> with the registry username your push-secret have access to:

```yaml
REGISTRY_ORG=<your_registry_org>
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1beta1
kind: Build
metadata:
  name: buildah-golang-build
spec:
  source:
    type: Git
    git:
      url: https://github.com/shipwright-io/sample-go
    contextDir: docker-build
  strategy:
    name: buildah-shipwright-managed-push
    kind: ClusterBuildStrategy
  paramValues:
  - name: dockerfile
    value: Dockerfile
  output:
    image: docker.io/${REGISTRY_ORG}/sample-golang:latest
    pushSecret: push-secret
    vulnerabilityScan:
      enabled: true
      failOnFinding: true # if set to true, then the image won't be pushed to the registry
EOF
```

To view the Build which you just created:

```
$ kubectl get builds

NAME                   REGISTERED   REASON      BUILDSTRATEGYKIND      BUILDSTRATEGYNAME                 CREATIONTIME
buildah-golang-build   True         Succeeded   ClusterBuildStrategy   buildah-shipwright-managed-push   72s
```

Now submit your buildrun

```yaml
cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1beta1
kind: BuildRun
metadata:
  generateName: buildah-golang-buildrun-
spec:
  build:
    name: buildah-golang-build
EOF
```

Wait until your BuildRun is completed and then you can view it as follows:

```
$ kubectl get buildruns

NAME                            SUCCEEDED   REASON                 STARTTIME   COMPLETIONTIME
buildah-golang-buildrun-s9gsh   False       VulnerabilitiesFound   2m54s       98s
```

Here, you can see that the buildrun failed with reason `VulnerabilitiesFound` and it will not push the image to the registry as the failOnFinding option is set to true.

And one can find the list of vulnerabilities in the build run status.Output

```yaml
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1beta1
