Shipwright Build v0.7.0 can be found on GitHub at [shipwright-io/build v0.7.0](https://github.com/shipwright-io/build/releases/tag/v0.7.0). The CLI is available at [shipwright-io/cli v0.7.0](https://github.com/shipwright-io/cli/releases/tag/v0.7.0).

This release includes a deprecation for build strategies: we as of today implicitely create an emptyDir volume for all volumeMounts in your steps. In the future, you will need to explicitely define them in the build strategy, but will also be able to use other volume types.

## Upgrade Instructions

1. Install v0.7.0 using the release YAML manifest:

   ```bash
   $ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/shipwright-io/build/releases/download/v0.7.0/release.yaml
   ```

2. (Optionally) Install the sample build strategies using the YAML manifest:

   ```bash
   $ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/shipwright-io/build/releases/download/v0.7.0/sample-strategies.yaml
   ```
