We are happy to announce the latest release of Shipwright's main projects - `v0.16.0`.
In this release, besides new features and fixes, we're excited to announce that we've launched
a brand new [website](https://shipwright.io/)! It's been redesigned from the ground up to better showcase the project,
make it easier to navigate, and help you find everything you need. Special thank you to [@rxinui](https://github.com/rxinui) for this core contribution!

## Key Features

Below are the key features in this release:

### Improving Git Clone

The `source.git.depth` was added to the `Build` resource to specify the depth of the Git history. 
If not specified the default value is 1 which means that no history is cloned at all, being the 
fastest way to clone a Git repository. Any value greater than 1 will create a clone with the specified depth.
For a full git history clone, depth must be set to 0.

### Optimizing Controller Memory Footprint

Improve the Shipwright controllerâ€™s memory efficiency by restricting the manager cache to only TaskRuns and Pods associated with the controller. This is achieved by leveraging the `buildrun.shipwright.io/name` label to identify relevant resources. By narrowing the scope of what the manager caches, we significantly reduce memory usage, resulting in a dramatic improvement in overall controller performance.

### CLI: Maintenance Update

The CLI was updated to support Build v0.16.0 APIs.

### Operator: Builds Upgrade

The operator was updated to deploy Builds v0.16.0.
